# juice-challenge
Coding challenge for potential Juicers. Applicants need to complete the following coding challenge and submit the solution as instructed. If you have any questions, please email nectar-dev@juicemobile.com

## Task Description
You are asked to create a simple web application which imports data from a CSV file uploaded by the user. The CSV file will contain rows of transactions and each transaction has these columns: date, category and spend.

1. There is an example of the CSV file named `transactions.csv` included in this repo which you should use for testing. Note that there should always be a header line and the order of the columns is not guaranteed. Not all data are formatted consistently and you are expected to parse them correctly.  All rows are parseable using the capabilities associated with the Python programming language.

2. Upon uploading the file, your app should display a table or a list of total spend per category.

3. Provide a search box for the user. When the user enters characters in the search box, the results should update by searching for transactions with categories partially matching the entered text. You may provide a button to trigger the search action.

## Submission and Evaluation
With your submission, include a copy of this README file and add your responses for each section below:

1. Your app should be easy to set up and run on Linux or Mac OS X. Be sure to include a detailed instruction on how to run your app.
2. Technically, there is not a strict time limit on this challenge but we encourage you to best optimize your energy. You should not get too ambitious and spend more than 4 to 5 hours. You can include a list of improvements you would like to make but chose not to. We will then discuss them during the on-site interview.
3. You are asked to showcase your strengths. For example, if you're a backend or full stack developer, you may want to show us how you create models, APIs or templates. If you are a front-end developer, you may want to do something fancy with the UI. Tell us what your strengths are and how they are reflected in your implementation.
4. Modify this README file and add a section for each of the following points:Provide a list of decisions you have made during this challenge. Are you proud of these decisions and why? Were you following any best practices? What would you have done differently?
5. You may not plagiarize by cloning other people's solutions. It's OK to modestly re-use your own boilerplates but make sure you strip out whatever is not needed for this particular task. You're expected to understand every line of code that you have submitted. During the on-site interview, we will ask you to take us through your code.
6. When you are ready to submit, include everything in a zip file and email to your point of contact.
